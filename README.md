# Ikikaeru
by h4xxel & slaeshjag of //achtung fulkod

## Story
Multiplayer block-stacking game. Build your tower higher than the opposing team to win.
The only way to get new building blocks is to spawn with them, so suicide is a feature!
When you have placed your block, kill yourself to respawn with a new one!

Some blocks have special features, such as the ladder, the dynamite and the turrets.
The different blocks also have different weights and different resistance to various kinds of bullets.

## Key bindings

 * Move using the arrow keys
 * Jump with [up]
 * Place block with [ctrl]

## Running under Linux
 * Install the following dependencies: libbz2, SDL, libmodplug
 * Make the binary executable (chmod +x ikikaeru)
 * Run it (./ikikaeru)

## Running under Windows
 * Run ikikaeru.exe

As usual, looking at the code might cause vomiting, diarrhea and/or cancer.

Greetings to B2 of Memory Leek for the sound effects.
